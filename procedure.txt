1. try to take the ST_segment_.... and take the signal from the physiobank ATM(the signal that are taken from the PhysioBANK).

2. The signal sampling rate are calculated below...

 


The signal sampling freqency is 250 hz or (250 / samples)

that means in 1 second there are 250 samples. or in 1 samples there are .004 seconds.

we are taking 120 ms as the elevated ST segment(regarding to some references)
